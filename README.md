This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately classify dog breeds from images. The model is built using TensorFlow, leveraging its powerful deep learning capabilities to perform image classification.

Key Features
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Utilized for extracting features from dog images to capture details for classification.
Transfer Learning: Implemented pre-trained models such as mobilenetv2 to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
Data Augmentation: Applied techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping to increase the diversity of training data and improve model generalization.
TensorFlow: Used for creating, training, and evaluating the neural network models.
Evaluation: The model performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test set of dog breed images.
Dataset
The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images, each corresponding to one of the many dog breeds. It was sourced from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Challenge.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to ensure the model can generalize well on unseen data.
Model Training: A CNN model is trained using TensorFlow with techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance, and hyperparameters are tuned to improve accuracy.
Prediction: The trained model can predict the breed of a dog from an image with a high degree of accuracy.
Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to distinguish between various dog breeds effectively.

Future Improvements
Explore additional pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
Implement fine-tuning of the pre-trained layers for more specialized feature extraction.
Expand the dataset to include mixed-breed dogs.
